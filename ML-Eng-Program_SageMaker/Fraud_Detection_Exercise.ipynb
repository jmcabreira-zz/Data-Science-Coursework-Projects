    "# Detecting Payment Card Fraud\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll look at a credit card fraud detection dataset, and build a binary classification model that can identify transactions as either fraudulent or valid, based on provided, *historical* data. In a [2016 study](https://nilsonreport.com/upload/content_promo/The_Nilson_Report_10-17-2016.pdf), it was estimated that credit card fraud was responsible for over 20 billion dollars in loss, worldwide. Accurately detecting cases of fraud is an ongoing area of research.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Labeled Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The payment fraud data set (Dal Pozzolo et al. 2015) was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data). This has features and labels for thousands of credit card transactions, each of which is labeled as fraudulent or valid. In this notebook, we'd like to train a model based on the features of these transactions so that we can predict risky or fraudulent transactions in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have true labels to aim for, we'll take a **supervised learning** approach and train a binary classifier to sort data into one of our two transaction classes: fraudulent or valid.  We'll train a model on training data and see how well it generalizes on some test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook will be broken down into a few steps:\n",
    "* Loading and exploring the data\n",
    "* Splitting the data into train/test sets\n",
    "* Defining and training a LinearLearner, binary classifier\n",
    "* Making improvements on the model\n",
    "* Evaluating and comparing model test performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of this notebook will focus on making improvements, as discussed in [this SageMaker blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/train-faster-more-flexible-models-with-amazon-sagemaker-linear-learner/). Specifically, we'll address techniques for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tuning a model's hyperparameters** and aiming for a specific metric, such as high recall or precision.\n",
    "2. **Managing class imbalance**, which is when we have many more training examples in one class than another (in this case, many more valid transactions than fraudulent).\n",

    "The default LinearLearner got a high accuracy, but still classified fraudulent and valid data points incorrectly. Specifically classifying more than 30 points as false negatives (incorrectly labeled, fraudulent transactions), and a little over 30 points as false positives (incorrectly labeled, valid transactions). Let's think about what, during training, could cause this behavior and what we could improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Model optimization**\n",
    "* If we imagine that we are designing this model for use in a bank application, we know that users do *not* want any valid transactions to be categorized as fraudulent. That is, we want to have as few **false positives** (0s classified as 1s) as possible. \n",
    "* On the other hand, if our bank manager asks for an application that will catch almost *all* cases of fraud, even if it means a higher number of false positives, then we'd want as few **false negatives** as possible.\n",

    "We have a model that is tuned to get a higher recall, which aims to reduce the number of false negatives. Earlier, we discussed how class imbalance may actually bias our model towards predicting that all transactions are valid, resulting in higher false negatives and true negatives. It stands to reason that this model could be further improved if we account for this imbalance.\n",

    "To account for class imbalance during training of a binary classifier, LinearLearner offers the hyperparameter, `positive_example_weight_mult`, which is the weight assigned to positive (1, fraudulent) examples when training a binary classifier.
