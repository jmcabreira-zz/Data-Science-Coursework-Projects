This is the repo in which I post some jupyter notebooks related to data science and my learning jorney.

# Projects:
- Population Segmentation with SageMaker
	- Employ two unsupervised learning algorithms to do population segmentation
	- Principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering
- Detecting Payment Card Fraud
	- Build a binary classification model that can identify transactions as either fraudulent or valid, based on historical data
	- Build a LinearLearner algorithm ( Sagemaker's built-in algorithm) 
- Moon Data Classification
	- Used PyTorch neural network to create a binary classifier for data that is separated into two classes
	- Built and deployed a custom model in SageMaker
- Forecasting Energy Consumption
	- Exploring a household electric power consumption dataset and building a energy consumption forecasting model 
	- building a DeepAR model which is one algorithm that utilizes a recurrent neural network - RNN
- Containment
	- Create containment features that first look at a whole body of text (and count up the occurrences of words in several text files) and then compare a submitted and source text, relative to the traits of the whole body of text.

 # About Me 
 
 
 I am an electrical engineer turned data scientist who loves leveraging data-driven solutions that make an impact on business and society. My first encounter with data science occurred when I worked as a student researcher at the Applied Computational Intelligence Laboratory (Fluminense Federal University) in which I built Artificial Neural Network models for power forecast.

Thereafter, I won a scholarship that allowed me to study at the University of Toronto in Canada. After this experience, I was given the opportunity to work with electrical projects and project management in a small company in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. My third working contract involved tasks related to the project management of two electrical substation construction projects in a multinational company.

Right now, I'm currently working for a company specialized on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and High Technology. I am also working as a Data Science Instructor for a famous DS platform.
